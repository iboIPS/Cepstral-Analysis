# Cepstral-Analysis
Build GUI app for Cepstral analysis.
This project is for Mechatronic System Identification Project class. 

The GUI app is designed in MATLAB built-in app-designer. 

Cepstral Analysis general algorithm steps: 
1. Signal Pre-processing
2. Frame Segmentation 
3. Windowing
4. Fourier Transform
5. Logarithmic Scaling 
6. Inverse Fourier Transform

App at start:

The app can load two types of file wav and mat file extensions. 

Then the user will choose the values to their signal and finnaly press update button. 

From Plot drop down we have four options.
