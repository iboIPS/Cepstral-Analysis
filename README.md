# Cepstral-Analysis
Build GUI app for Cepstral analysis.
This project is for Mechatronic System Identification. 

The GUI app is needs to be designed in MATLAB. 

To-DO Cepstral Analysis, we need to follow a six general step: 
1. Signal Pre-processing
2. Frame Segmentation 
3. Windowing
4. Fourier Transform
5. Logarithmic Scaling 
6. Inverse Fourier Transform
